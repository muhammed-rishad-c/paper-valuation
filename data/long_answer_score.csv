0,s17,Arjun,q7,"The greenhouse effect is a vital natural phenomenon that keeps Earth habitable by warming its surface. When solar radiation reaches Earth, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor in the atmosphere absorb the outgoing thermal radiation and re-emit it back toward the surface.

1,s17,Arjun,q8,"Deforestation has two primary environmental consequences. First, it leads to severe biodiversity loss because forests serve as complex ecosystems supporting countless species of plants, animals, and microorganisms - when these habitats are destroyed, many species face extinction. Second, deforestation significantly contributes to climate change since trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, so when forests are cleared, this stored carbon is released and fewer trees remain to absorb atmospheric greenhouse gases.","['One major consequence of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity due to habitat destruction.', 'Another consequence is the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases, as forests absorb carbon dioxide.']",8,7.5
2,s17,Arjun,q9,"The water cycle is a continuous process with four main stages. Evaporation occurs when solar energy heats surface water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, converting liquid water into water vapor that rises into the atmosphere. Condensation happens when this water vapor cools at higher altitudes and transforms back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds and fog. Precipitation takes place when these water droplets combine and become heavy enough to fall back to Earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Collection is the final stage where precipitated water flows into streams, rivers, and eventually returns to larger water bodies like lakes and oceans, completing the cycle.","['Evaporation is the process where water turns into vapor from heat.', 'Condensation is when water vapor cools and forms clouds.', 'Precipitation occurs when water falls back to Earth as rain or snow.', 'Collection is when water gathers in large bodies like rivers and oceans.']",10,7.5

4,s17,Arjun,q11,"Biomagnification is the process by which the concentration of toxic substances increases progressively at each higher trophic level in a food chain or food web. This occurs because certain toxins, particularly fat-soluble compounds like DDT, mercury, and PCBs, are not easily broken down or eliminated by organisms and instead accumulate in fatty tissues. As smaller organisms containing these toxins are consumed by larger predators, the toxins become concentrated in the predator's body. This is particularly dangerous for apex predators like eagles, sharks, and humans, as they can accumulate lethal concentrations of toxins that can cause neurological damage, reproductive failure, and death.","['Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of a toxin in organisms at higher levels of a food chain.', ""It occurs because fat-soluble toxins like DDT or mercury accumulate in an organism's tissues and are not easily excreted."", ""It's a concern because high toxin levels in top predators can cause severe health issues or death.""]",8,7.0
5,s18,Kavya,q7,"The greenhouse effect is Earth's natural heating system that maintains temperatures suitable for life. Solar radiation enters the atmosphere and warms the planet's surface. Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and water vapor then absorb the heat energy that Earth radiates back toward space and re-emit this energy in all directions, including back to the surface.

6,s18,Kavya,q8,"Two major environmental impacts of deforestation are biodiversity loss and increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Forests are home to approximately 80% of terrestrial biodiversity, so when they're destroyed, countless species lose their habitats and face potential extinction. Additionally, forests function as massive carbon storage systems, absorbing CO2 during photosynthesis and storing it in wood and soil. When forests are cut down, this stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, and the Earth loses these important carbon-absorbing systems, accelerating climate change.","['One major consequence of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity due to habitat destruction.', 'Another consequence is the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases, as forests absorb carbon dioxide.']",8,7.0
7,s18,Kavya,q9,"The water cycle consists of four continuous processes that circulate water through Earth's systems. Evaporation transforms liquid water from oceans, rivers, and lakes into invisible water vapor using energy from the sun. Condensation occurs when rising water vapor cools in the atmosphere and changes back into tiny liquid droplets, creating clouds. Precipitation happens when these droplets grow large enough to fall from clouds as rain, snow, or other forms of moisture. Collection completes the cycle as precipitated water flows across land into streams, rivers, and ultimately returns to oceans and other large water bodies.","['Evaporation is the process where water turns into vapor from heat.', 'Condensation is when water vapor cools and forms clouds.', 'Precipitation occurs when water falls back to Earth as rain or snow.', 'Collection is when water gathers in large bodies like rivers and oceans.']",10,7.5

Economic sustainability seeks to maintain steady economic growth while using resources efficiently and creating systems that can endure over time without depleting natural or social capital.","['Sustainable development meets present needs without compromising the future.', 'The first pillar is environmental sustainability, focusing on protecting natural resources.', 'The second pillar is social sustainability, aiming for a just and equitable society.', 'The third pillar is economic sustainability, which seeks to maintain a strong and stable economy.']",14,10.5
9,s18,Kavya,q11,"Biomagnification describes how toxic substances become increasingly concentrated as they move up through food chain levels. This phenomenon occurs with fat-soluble toxins such as heavy metals like mercury and persistent organic pollutants like DDT, which cannot be easily eliminated from an organism's body and instead accumulate in fatty tissues. When a contaminated organism is eaten by a predator, these toxins transfer and concentrate in the predator's tissues. The concern is greatest for top predators, including humans, who may accumulate dangerous levels of these toxins that can cause serious health problems, reproductive issues, and even death.","['Biomagnification is the increasing concentration of a toxin in organisms at higher levels of a food chain.', ""It occurs because fat-soluble toxins like DDT or mercury accumulate in an organism's tissues and are not easily excreted."", ""It's a concern because high toxin levels in top predators can cause severe health issues or death.""]",8,6.5
10,s19,Rahul,q7,"The greenhouse effect is a natural process where atmospheric gases trap solar energy to warm Earth's surface.

11,s19,Rahul,q8,"Deforestation causes two significant environmental problems. The first is massive biodiversity loss because forests contain incredibly diverse ecosystems with millions of species that depend on forest habitats for survival - destroying these forests leads to species extinction. The second major consequence is that deforestation increases atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, as trees naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the air through photosynthesis, so removing forests means less CO2 absorption and more greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere.","['One major consequence of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity due to habitat destruction.', 'Another consequence is the increase of atmospheric greenhouse gases, as forests absorb carbon dioxide.']",8,7.0
12,s19,Rahul,q9,"The water cycle involves four key processes that continuously move water around Earth.
