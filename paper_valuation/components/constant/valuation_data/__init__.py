            "q7": "The greenhouse effect is a vital natural phenomenon that keeps Earth habitable by warming its surface. When solar radiation reaches Earth, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor in the atmosphere absorb the outgoing thermal radiation and re-emit it back toward the surface. This process of absorption and re-radiation by atmospheric gases is what creates the warming effect that maintains Earth's temperature suitable for life.",
            "q8": "Deforestation has two primary environmental consequences. First, it leads to severe biodiversity loss because forests serve as complex ecosystems supporting countless species of plants, animals, and microorganisms - when these habitats are destroyed, many species face extinction. Second, deforestation significantly contributes to climate change since trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, so when forests are cleared, this stored carbon is released and fewer trees remain to absorb atmospheric greenhouse gases.",
            "q9": "The water cycle is a continuous process with four main stages. Evaporation occurs when solar energy heats surface water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, converting liquid water into water vapor that rises into the atmosphere. Condensation happens when this water vapor cools at higher altitudes and transforms back into tiny water droplets, forming clouds and fog. Precipitation takes place when these water droplets combine and become heavy enough to fall back to Earth's surface as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Collection is the final stage where precipitated water flows into streams, rivers, and eventually returns to larger water bodies like lakes and oceans, completing the cycle.",
            "q10": "Sustainable development is a comprehensive approach to progress that satisfies current human needs while ensuring future generations can meet their own needs. It operates on three interconnected pillars. Environmental sustainability focuses on protecting and preserving natural resources, ecosystems, and biodiversity for long-term ecological health. Social sustainability emphasizes creating equitable societies where all people have access to basic needs, education, healthcare, and opportunities for a decent quality of life. Economic sustainability involves maintaining robust economic growth and prosperity while ensuring resources are used efficiently and economic systems remain stable over time.",
            "q11": "Biomagnification is the process by which the concentration of toxic substances increases progressively at each higher trophic level in a food chain or food web. This occurs because certain toxins, particularly fat-soluble compounds like DDT, mercury, and PCBs, are not easily broken down or eliminated by organisms and instead accumulate in fatty tissues. As smaller organisms containing these toxins are consumed by larger predators, the toxins become concentrated in the predator's body. This is particularly dangerous for apex predators like eagles, sharks, and humans, as they can accumulate lethal concentrations of toxins that can cause neurological damage, reproductive failure, and death."

            "q7": "The greenhouse effect is Earth's natural heating system that maintains temperatures suitable for life. Solar radiation enters the atmosphere and warms the planet's surface. Greenhouse gases like CO2, methane, and water vapor then absorb the heat energy that Earth radiates back toward space and re-emit this energy in all directions, including back to the surface. This natural process of energy absorption and re-radiation by atmospheric gases is essential for keeping our planet warm enough to support life.",
            "q8": "Two major environmental impacts of deforestation are biodiversity loss and increased greenhouse gas concentrations. Forests are home to approximately 80% of terrestrial biodiversity, so when they're destroyed, countless species lose their habitats and face potential extinction. Additionally, forests function as massive carbon storage systems, absorbing CO2 during photosynthesis and storing it in wood and soil. When forests are cut down, this stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, and the Earth loses these important carbon-absorbing systems, accelerating climate change.",
            "q9": "The water cycle consists of four continuous processes that circulate water through Earth's systems. Evaporation transforms liquid water from oceans, rivers, and lakes into invisible water vapor using energy from the sun. Condensation occurs when rising water vapor cools in the atmosphere and changes back into tiny liquid droplets, creating clouds. Precipitation happens when these droplets grow large enough to fall from clouds as rain, snow, or other forms of moisture. Collection completes the cycle as precipitated water flows across land into streams, rivers, and ultimately returns to oceans and other large water bodies.",
            "q10": "Sustainable development represents a balanced approach to human progress that meets today's needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs. This concept rests on three essential pillars working together. Environmental sustainability involves protecting natural ecosystems, conserving biodiversity, and managing resources responsibly to maintain planetary health. Social sustainability focuses on ensuring fair distribution of resources, equal opportunities, and basic human rights for all people in society. Economic sustainability seeks to maintain steady economic growth while using resources efficiently and creating systems that can endure over time without depleting natural or social capital.",
            "q11": "Biomagnification describes how toxic substances become increasingly concentrated as they move up through food chain levels. This phenomenon occurs with fat-soluble toxins such as heavy metals like mercury and persistent organic pollutants like DDT, which cannot be easily eliminated from an organism's body and instead accumulate in fatty tissues. When a contaminated organism is eaten by a predator, these toxins transfer and concentrate in the predator's tissues. The concern is greatest for top predators, including humans, who may accumulate dangerous levels of these toxins that can cause serious health problems, reproductive issues, and even death."

Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide and water vapor, absorb this outgoing thermal radiation and re-emit it in all directions, including back down to Earth. This re-radiation of energy by atmospheric gases is what creates the warming effect necessary for life on our planet.",
            "q8": "Deforestation causes two significant environmental problems. The first is massive biodiversity loss because forests contain incredibly diverse ecosystems with millions of species that depend on forest habitats for survival - destroying these forests leads to species extinction. The second major consequence is that deforestation increases atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, as trees naturally absorb carbon dioxide from the air through photosynthesis, so removing forests means less CO2 absorption and more greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere.",

Evaporation uses solar heat to convert liquid water from surfaces like oceans and lakes into water vapor that rises into the atmosphere. Condensation occurs when this vapor cools at higher altitudes and forms tiny water droplets that create clouds. Precipitation takes place when these droplets combine and fall back to Earth as various forms like rain or snow.

This process of atmospheric absorption and re-emission of thermal energy is what keeps Earth warm enough to support life.",

Forests provide complex ecosystems that support countless species of flora and fauna, so when these habitats are destroyed, many species face extinction due to loss of their natural homes.

            "q10": "Sustainable development is about using renewable resources like wind energy and hydroelectric power. We should ban fossil fuels and use only clean energy to save the environment.",
            "q11": "Biomagnification happens in marine ecosystems where plastic pollution affects sea animals. Whales and dolphins eat plastic thinking it's food, which causes them to die."

            "q7": "The greenhouse effect is caused by deforestation. When there are fewer trees, more heat gets trapped in the atmosphere because trees provide shade and cooling.",
            "q8": "Cutting down trees reduces the amount of wood available for making paper and furniture. It also disturbs the natural beauty of forests and affects tourism.",
            "q9": "Rain is formed when clouds collide with each other. Lightning and thunder also help in forming rain. Different types of clouds make different types of precipitation.",
            "q10": "Sustainable development is when governments make policies to protect wildlife. National parks and wildlife sanctuaries are examples of sustainable development.",
            "q11": "Biomagnification is when scientists study the magnification of small organisms under microscopes. This helps in understanding biodiversity and ecosystem relationships."
