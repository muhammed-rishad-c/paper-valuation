    "q1": {
        "question": "What is photosynthesis and what are its essential components?",
        "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water. The key components required are sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and the pigment chlorophyll."
        
    },
    "q2": {
        "question": "Explain Newton's Second Law of Motion.",
        "answer": "Newton's Second Law states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is expressed as the formula $F = ma$."

    },
    "q3": {
        "question": "What was the primary objective of the Dandi March (Salt March)?",
        "answer": "The Dandi March was an act of nonviolent civil disobedience to protest the unjust British salt tax. Its wider objective was to challenge British authority and galvanize the population for independence."

    },
    "q4": {
        "question": "Describe the formation of sedimentary rocks.",
        "answer": "Sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation of sediments from pre-existing rocks. These sediments are deposited in layers and then undergo compaction and cementation over time, hardening into rock."

    },
    "q5": {
        "question": "What is the role of an Operating System (OS)? Name one key function.",
        "answer": "An Operating System acts as an intermediary between the user and computer hardware, managing all resources. A key function is memory management, which allocates memory to programs."

    },
    "q6": {
        "question": "What is a neutralisation reaction? Provide the general products.",
        "answer": "A neutralisation reaction is a chemical reaction between an acid and a base. The reaction results in the formation of two main products: a salt and water."

    },
    "q7": {
        "question": "Define democracy and list two of its fundamental principles.",
        "answer": "Democracy is a system of government by the people, through freely elected representatives. Two fundamental principles are ensuring free and fair elections and upholding the rule of law for all citizens."

    },
    "q8": {
        "question": "What is the difference between a producer and a consumer in an ecosystem?",
        "answer": "Producers, like plants, are autotrophs that create their own food using sunlight. Consumers are heterotrophs that cannot make their own food and must obtain energy by eating other organisms."

    },
    "q9": {
        "question": "What is an IP address, and why is it necessary?",
        "answer": "An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to a device on a network. It is necessary for identification of the device and for location addressing, which allows data to be routed correctly."
 
    },
    "q10": {
        "question": "State the law of conservation of energy.",
        "answer": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another in an isolated system."

# Of course. To test the various capabilities of your valuation model, you need a diverse set of student answers. This sample includes five students who represent different scenarios:

# 1.  **Aarav:** The high-achiever whose answers are mostly correct and detailed.
# 2.  **Bhavna:** The confused student who often provides incorrect or out-of-context answers.
# 3.  **Chetan:** The concise student who is often right but lacks detail, testing partial scoring.
# 4.  **Diya:** The average student whose answers contain minor spelling and grammatical errors.
# 5.  **Eshan:** A student who provides some good answers but skips others, testing how your model handles missing data.
